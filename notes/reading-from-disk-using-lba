    ; Now we want to load stage two at 0x10000

    ; We'll use Logical Block Addressing, although we got CHS working too
    ; Reading sectors from the disk using Logical Block Addressing
    ; Reading 16 sectors from LBA 1 to physical address 0x10000
    mov bx, 0x0000      ; was 0x07c0
    mov ds, bx
    mov si, INIT+DAP    ; address of "disk address packet"
    mov ah, 0x42        ; ah = BIOS call number for this int 0x13 call
    mov dl, 0x80        ; dl = "drive number." Typically 0x80
    int 0x13

    jmp 0x1000:0x0000

    jmp die

DAP:
        db    0x10      ; size of this disk address packet (16)
        db    0         ; always zero
sectrs: dw    16        ; number of sectors (blocks) to copy (1 works)
dstloc: dw    0x0000    ; where to copy the data (offset)
        dw    0x1000    ; where to copy the data (segment)
srcloc: dd    1         ; starting LBA (starts at 0, so do 1. 0 flashes!)
        dd    0         ; used for upper part of 48 bit LBAs
