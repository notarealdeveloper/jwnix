; BIOS DATA AREA: 0x00000400 - 0x000004ff (256 bytes)
; ===================================================
; Below, we note several places in the BIOS data area where information
; about the hardware is stored. Using these locations to get the relevant
; information will make our code more portable than the current strategy,
; in which we just use the correct IO ports and memory locations
; directly. So why not do this everywhere in the code now? Well, I'm
; trying not to even use the  BIOS (i.e., no BIOS calls in my code,
; after the BIOS loads us) so while the BDA strategy may give us more
; portability, it also involves using code written by others, which is
; exactly what I'm trying to avoid, in order to achieve maximum
; learnin's :-D

; VGA base IO port: RAM 0x0463.
; Qemu: [0x0463] = 0x3d4
; This port number is needed for getting and setting cursor position. 
; We just assume it's 0x3d4, and that works. 

; VGAWIDTH: RAM 0x044A
; Qemu: [0x044A] = 80
; This lets us replace the long cmp line in clear_screen with
; mov         dx,     [0x044A]
; imul        dx,     VGAHEIGHT
; imul        dx,     CHARSIZE
; add         edx,    0xb8000
